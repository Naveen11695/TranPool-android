> Android Application




## In order to develop the software, the following approach is adopted:

➢ Registered entrepreneurs will specify the quantity of manufactured product/handiwork they want to sell, base price, the minimum quantity of order for which they will provide transportation according to its perishability, its timeframe and the minimum and maximum distance for which they deliver the product if it lies between the location difference of entrepreneurs and end-users.

➢ The portal will also include the details of transporters who are in touch with them for delivering that placed order. This includes the tie-up with Sea transport, Rail transport, Air transport and any other types of a transportation system which is the requirement of the application system.

➢ In particular, the software is designed to address the various issues of the transportation system such as the type of vehicle (for example. Refrigerated vehicle, large vehicle, etc.). Further, the transport system can be customized to be integrated with insurance agencies for long-distance transport of products.

➢ The purchaser (end user) will place the order by providing the details of the product, its quantity, destination etc. The software will provide the list of registered entrepreneurs who have a product as per the demand of the purchaser.

➢ The software will generate the transportation cost for the delivery of the goods or products to the end user (or a group of users lying within the domain of delivery area). This cost would be automatically conveyed to the end user and upon its acceptance, the order is processed once an advance purchase amount is received by the entrepreneur.

➢ In order to arrive at the minimum transportation cost, currently, Vogel approximation method algorithm is applied. However, the software can be customized to include other methodologies as well.

➢ The software is designed to generate miscellaneous reports such as order tracking, details of transport, details of vehicles etc.
